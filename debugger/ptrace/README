This is a simple example of using ptrace() system call to be used by a parent process to interecept all syscalls used by another process in i386 and x86_64 systems.

To run:
$ptrace_debugger name_of_the_binary arguments

For example "$./ptrace_debuger /bin/ls -ali" generates a file called "syscalls.log" in the current directory.
