This is a simple example of using ptrace syscall to be used by a parent process to identify all syscalls used by another process in i386 and x86_64 systems.

To run:
ptrace_debugger name_of_the_binary

For example  $./ptrace_debuger /bin/ls generates a file called log.txt in the current directory containing the syscalls.
